This is a Plugin for Using the ARX Library from arx.deidentifier.com in a Pentaho ETL Project.

The SWT libraries for win32 and linux are included to compile the project.
If you for some reason require the libs for other platforms, just copying them over from the "Kettle" project will solve your problem.

Please check for later versions for the Kettle-jars in the libext folder. The actual included jars are from a development release 3.0.0 M2.

If you build this, the result will be in folder "ARXPluginForDeploy".
